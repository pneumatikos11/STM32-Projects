## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a variety of example projects for the STM32 Blue Pill board. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find useful examples and tutorials to enhance your skills in embedded systems and microcontroller programming.

## Projects

### Blink LED

A simple project to get started with STM32 development. This project demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to one of the GPIO pins of the Blue Pill board.

- **Components**: Blue Pill, LED, Resistor
- **Code**: [blink_led.ino](./projects/blink_led/blink_led.ino)

### Serial Communication

Learn how to set up UART communication between the Blue Pill board and your computer. This project shows how to send and receive data over a serial connection.

- **Components**: Blue Pill, USB-to-Serial Adapter
- **Code**: [serial_comm.ino](./projects/serial_comm/serial_comm.ino)

### Temperature Sensor

Read temperature data from a DS18B20 sensor and display it on the serial monitor. This project covers the basics of interfacing with sensors and data acquisition.

- **Components**: Blue Pill, DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- **Code**: [temp_sensor.ino](./projects/temp_sensor/temp_sensor.ino)

### Motor Control

Control a DC motor using PWM signals generated by the Blue Pill board. This project demonstrates motor speed control and direction using an H-Bridge.

- **Components**: Blue Pill, DC Motor, L298N H-Bridge
- **Code**: [motor_control.ino](./projects/motor_control/motor_control.ino)

### OLED Display

Display text and graphics on a 128x64 OLED screen. This project illustrates how to use the I2C protocol for communication between the Blue Pill and the OLED display.

- **Components**: Blue Pill, 128x64 OLED Display
- **Code**: [oled_display.ino](./projects/oled_display/oled_display.ino)

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill board
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Various components as listed in each project

## Software Requirements

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) with STM32 support
- [ST-Link V2](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) for programming and debugging


Happy coding with STM32!
